# Introduction
  
Workshop 1 has introduced (or reminded) you to plotting data in R.
This brief workshop will introduce you to a different way of plotting using R, using the `ggplot2` package. `ggplot2` is a system of creating visually pleasing graphics in a simple, easy-to-understand and visually pleasing manner^[`ggplot2` was reated by Hadley Wickham in 2005, based on theory developed by the statistician and computer scientist Leland Wilkinson in his 1999 book "The grammar of graphics".].
Behind `ggplot2` lies a complex philosophy of visualisation, thus it is very hard to give you a quick, comprehensive view of it. This workshop will give you the basics and, if you are interested, you can pursue this further^[There are too many guides online (of which a lot are free) for me to list here. If you are really super-interested in this, you can try and read Hadley Wickham's book "ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" which is probably one of the best references you can get.].

# Learning objectives

After completing this workshop you will be able to:

* Use the basic features of ggplot

# Installing and loading ggplot2

As always, when using a non standard R package, you need to install it first using^[This may take a while, it's normal.].

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.package("ggplot2")
```

Once installed (which you only do once) you can load it using

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
```

# Aesthetics and geometries

The philosophy behind ggplot is that each plot is made out of _layers_ that you can manipulate individually. The main command you are going to use for generating plots is `ggplot`.

But, first of all, let's load up some data! I am going to reuse the dataset from Workshop 1, `metab-workshop1.csv`^[Refer to Workshop 1 for the dataset description].

```{r}
metab <- read.csv("metab-workshop1.csv")
```

We can now pass the dataset to `ggplot`, and define the _aesthetics_ that map the data to visual aspects of the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Treatment, y = Concentration))
```

But... wait a moment, there is nothing on the plot! That is because we did not tell `ggplot` what type of plot we want. Let's try again... this time asking for a boxplot. This is done by using geometries, that are generated through the `geom_....` functions. In our case we are going to use `geom_boxplot`. Because we want to add a new layer to our plot, we use `+` to add the boxplot. Easy, isn't it?

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Treatment, y = Concentration)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

If you wanted to plot an histogram, instead, you could do

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Concentration)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20) # Or use bin to set the number of bins
```

But, let's say we want something more complicated, for instance adding some points over the boxplot, how do we go about it? We just add another layer using `geom_point`^[Note: you can always save the result of the plot into a variable and then add to that. For example `g <- ggplot(....)` and then `g + geom_boxplot()`.]

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Treatment, y = Concentration)) +
  # Avoid plotting outliers on the boxplot, 
  # since we are adding points on top
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + 
  geom_point()
```

Alternatively, try to use `geom_jitter` instead of `geom_point` to get some _jittered_ points, as below^[Use the `width` parameter to change the amount of jitter.]

```{r echo = F, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Treatment, y = Concentration)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1)
```

Let's now colour the points by sex, and make them smaller. Note that, since we are mapping a new variable to an aspect of the plot we need to be redefining the plot aesthetics^[Why don't we put the _col_ parameter in the first `aes` block? Try it for yourself and see!].

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Treatment, y = Concentration)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, aes(col = Sex), size = 0.5)
```

What happens if you map the color to Age instead? Try it and see why `ggplot2` makes it so easy to produce neat plots.

**Challenge**: can you plot two superimposed histograms of the metabolite concentration, one for men and one for women?

# Faceting

The plot above is very pretty, but it is quite complicated to clearly see M vs F. One way we could go about this is faceting, that is, splitting the plot into subplots as follows

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Treatment, y = Concentration)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, size = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(~Sex)
```

The `~Sex` notation tells `ggplot2` to split the plot by Sex. This can also be used on multiple variables. Let's create a new one, by dividing people in Young (<=60 years old), and Old (>60 years old)^[An absolutely arbitrary decision...]

```{r}
metab$AgeCateg <- ifelse(metab$Age <= 60, "Young", "Old")
```

Now we can facet on Sex and AgeCateg

```{r, tidy = FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Treatment, y = Concentration)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, size = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(AgeCateg~Sex)
```

What does the following code do instead?
```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Treatment, y = Concentration)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, size = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(AgeCateg~.)
```

# More complex features

We will finish this workshop with a more complex graph. This is really just the _tip of the iceberg_, but hopefully it has given you some inspiration to pursue this further in your own time!

Consider the following plot

```{r tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Age, y = Concentration)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = Sex)) 
```

Let's say we want to fit a line through that. We can use a "smoother"

```{r tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Age, y = Concentration)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = Sex), size = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

This fits a line (calling `lm` in the background... have a look at your notes from last year if you don't remember what that does!) through all the points^[Note the light gray shading around the line, those are confidence intervals for the fit.]. However, wouldn't it be nicer to have a line for males and one for females? That's easily done! 
\newpage

```{r tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = metab, aes(x = Age, y = Concentration)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = Sex), size = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(col = Sex))
```


# Now it's your turn!
